# OBS Website

This is the new OBS website built as low to HTML+CSS as possible. To enable easy maintenance and editorial duties using markdown, a simple static site project was chose. To minimize the number of dependencies and maintenance burden, a rust based [Cobalt](https://cobalt-org.github.io/) project was chose despite it's lack of maturity compared to, say, Jekyll. 

Deployment hapens automatically using github actions/CI. [Live preview here](https://jimmac.github.io/obsproject.org/).
