# Contributing to OBS

## Thank You!

Thank you for your interest in supporting our work!

Open Broadcaster Software is an open source project freely available under the GPL and developed by a dedicated team of passionate individuals.

They also go towards software licenses and other project expenses such as website and server hosting.

It's important to us that OBS is available free without advertisements and your contributions make that possible!
